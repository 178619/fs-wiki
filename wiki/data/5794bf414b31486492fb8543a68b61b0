[[Fortune Summoners Plus -Arche's Wondrous Labyrinth-]] <small>({{langx|ja|フォーチュンサモナーズPlus～アルチェの不思議なラビリンス～}})</small> is an expansion pack for the game [[Fortune Summoners]]. It was released on the same day with the physical package edition [[Fortune Summoners Deluxe]] that contained the expansion pack.

It was stated that the expansion pack for the Steam version of the game is on the way as a paid DLC, but it hasn't been released so far. However, the Steam version can detect the expansion pack, meaning the pack from it can be played normally, after applying the expansion pack much like how the other versions allow it to.

Although it was never released for the English version translated by [[Carpe Fulgur]], the game files do contain the translations for the new items, gamemodes and regions. However, the gamemode [[Arche's Wondrous Labyrinth|アルチェの不思議なラビリンス]] was translated into ''Arche's Wondrous Labyrinth'', and the region [[Mysterious Labyrinth|不思議な迷宮]] was translated into ''Mysterious Labyrinth'', ultimately causing minor confusions due to the inconsistent names.

== New Gamemodes ==
