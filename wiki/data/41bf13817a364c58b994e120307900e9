[[Fortune Summoners Deluxe]] <small>({{langx|ja|フォーチュンサモナーズ～アルチェの精霊石～Deluxe}})</small> was a physical package edition of the game [[Fortune Summoners]]. It was released on the same day with the expansion pack [[Fortune Summoners Plus]] that was a part of the package.

The package had 1 CD-ROM installer media, user manuals, design works collection and a paper with a user id and an auth code written on it.

== Voice Acting ==
Voices for important scenes in the main storyline were added for the Deluxe version. Battle voices were also re-recored by these actors. Players are able to choose between the original version and the deluxe version for the battle voices.

{{main|Fortune Summoners Plus -Arche's Wondrous Labyrinth-}}
Fortune Summoners Plus is automatically installed along with the main game when the installer for the deluxe version is used.

While it is possible to delete the file for the expansion pack and play the deluxe version without the new gamemodes, there really isn't any reason to do so for most players.

== Design Works Collection ==
The package comes with a design works collection that also includes new illustrations by [[Takeda Mika]] and comments from [[MEL]].
